# MyJSHacks
Collection of some of my cool JS Projects.

## About the Project
Here, there are 6 JavaScript projects, where I've used some modern JavaScript concepts and No Frameworks, No Libraries, No Boilerplate has been used in these projects.

- The first project is CSS Variables. Here I’ve done a 
simple animation using CSS Variables that can be updated by JavaScript. [Demo](https://souravinsights.github.io/CSS-Variables/)
- The second 
project is JS Drumkit. Here, when you hit the corresponding key on your keyboard it's going to 
play the corresponding sound that is associated with the key [Demo](https://souravinsights.github.io/drumkit/)
- The third project is JS 
Can Speak. Here I’ve used the browser’s speech synthesis API to create a text to speech app
